## Security Design Principles

### Defense in Depth Architecture
**Global Edge Protection**: CloudFront and WAF provide the first line of defense at 400+ global locations
**Application Layer Filtering**: Multiple rule groups covering different attack vectors and threat intelligence
**Origin Protection**: S3 bucket secured with OAC, preventing direct access bypass attempts
**Browser Security**: Comprehensive security headers providing client-side protection controls

### Integration with Existing Security Systems
**VPC Network Security**: Application layer protection complements existing Security Groups and NACLs
**Security Hub Automation**: WAF logs integrate with existing EventBridge and Lambda incident response
**Identity Integration**: Protection works seamlessly with IAM Identity Center federated users
**Audit Compliance**: Complete request logging supports existing CloudTrail audit requirements

### Production-Ready Security Patterns
**Count vs Block Methodology**: Safe rule deployment preventing false positive disruption
**Rate Limiting Strategy**: Balances legitimate user activity with DDoS protection requirements
**Geographic Compliance**: Country-level restrictions supporting sanctions and regulatory requirements
**Scalable Rule Management**: Managed rules automatically updated with AWS threat intelligence

---

## Attack Simulation and Validation

### Comprehensive Security Testing
**XSS Protection Validation**: Script injection attempts blocked with 403 Forbidden responses
**SQL Injection Prevention**: Database attack patterns blocked before reaching origin systems
**Rate Limiting Effectiveness**: DDoS simulation triggering protection at configured thresholds
**Geographic Restriction Testing**: Access denied from blocked countries with appropriate responses

### Real-World Threat Scenarios
**Application Layer Attacks**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities blocked by managed rule groups
**Volumetric Attacks**: Rate limiting and AWS Shield integration providing DDoS protection
**Geographic Threats**: Country-level blocking reducing attack surface from high-risk regions
**Browser-Based Attacks**: Security headers preventing clickjacking, CSRF, and content injection
