## Key Exam Topics Mastered

### 1. AWS WAF Rule Types and Evaluation Order
**What the exam tests:**
- Understanding managed rule groups vs custom rules decision criteria
- Rule priority and evaluation sequence in complex configurations
- Count vs Block methodology for safe production deployment

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"A company needs to implement WAF protection that blocks SQL injection but allows legitimate database queries from their application. The security team wants to test rules before enforcement. What's the safest deployment approach?"*

**Lab connection:** You implemented the exact Count â†’ Block methodology tested in exam scenarios, with comprehensive logging for rule validation.

### 2. CloudFront Security Integration Patterns
**What the exam tests:**
- Origin Access Control (OAC) vs Origin Access Identity (OAI) decision criteria
- Security headers implementation through CloudFront response policies
- Global edge protection with geographic and rate-based restrictions

**Real exam question pattern:**

### 3. DDoS Protection and Rate Limiting
**What the exam tests:**
- Rate-based rules configuration for volumetric attack protection
- AWS Shield Standard vs Advanced decision patterns
- Integration between CloudFront caching and WAF rate limiting

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"A web application experiences periodic traffic spikes that overwhelm the origin servers. The security team needs to distinguish between legitimate traffic surges and DDoS attacks. What AWS services provide this capability?"*

**Lab connection:** You implemented rate-based rules with CloudFront integration, demonstrating the exact DDoS protection patterns tested in exam scenarios.

### 4. Geographic Access Controls for Compliance
**What the exam tests:**
- Implementing geographic restrictions for regulatory compliance
- Understanding the difference between CloudFront geo-restriction and WAF geographic rules

## Advanced WAF and CloudFront Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Rule Capacity and Performance Optimization
**Exam Context:** Optimizing WAF performance while maintaining comprehensive protection

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Web ACL Capacity Units (WCUs)**: Each rule group consumes capacity, max 1500 WCUs per Web ACL
- **Managed rule groups**: More efficient than equivalent custom rules
- **Rule evaluation order**: Lower priority numbers execute first, early termination on match
- **Rate-based rules**: Less capacity intensive than complex string matching rules

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Choose managed rule groups for standard protection, custom rules for application-specific threats, optimize rule order for performance.

### Scenario 2: Security Headers and Browser Protection
**Exam Context:** Implementing comprehensive browser-level security controls

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS through resource loading restrictions
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS with preload list inclusion
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking through frame embedding control
- **Permissions Policy**: Disables dangerous browser APIs (camera, geolocation, microphone)

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Layer browser security controls with application security controls for defense in depth.

### Scenario 3: Origin Protection and Access Control
**Exam Context:** Securing application origins from direct access bypass

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Origin Access Control (OAC)**: Current best practice using AWS Signature v4
- **Origin Access Identity (OAI)**: Legacy approach still referenced in exam questions
- **Bucket policies**: Must explicitly allow CloudFront service with condition restrictions
- **Custom headers**: Additional layer of origin protection verification

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Always choose OAC for new implementations, understand OAI for legacy scenario questions.

### Scenario 4: Logging and Monitoring Integration
**Exam Context:** Implementing comprehensive security monitoring and incident response

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **WAF logging**: Full request details including rule matches and actions
- **CloudFront access logs**: Origin request patterns and edge location performance
- **CloudWatch metrics**: Real-time security event monitoring and alerting
- **Security Hub integration**: Centralized security finding management

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Combine multiple logging sources for comprehensive security visibility and automated response.

## Common Exam Question Patterns

### Multiple Choice: Service Selection for Web Application Protection
**Question Pattern:** "A global web application needs protection from OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, DDoS attacks, and geographic restrictions while maintaining high performance. Which AWS service combination provides this capability?"

**Key Discriminators:**
- **CloudFront + WAF**: Global edge protection with application filtering (correct for comprehensive coverage)
- **ALB + WAF**: Regional protection only (insufficient for global requirements)
- **Route 53 + Shield**: DNS protection but no application layer filtering
- **API Gateway + Lambda**: API protection but not suitable for web application content

**Common wrong answers:**
- Using only AWS Shield without WAF (no application layer protection)
- Implementing security only at origin without edge protection
- Choosing regional solutions for global protection requirements

### Multiple Choice: WAF Rule Configuration and Troubleshooting
**Question Pattern:** "A WAF deployment blocks legitimate user traffic while allowing some malicious requests through. The security team needs to optimize rule configuration. What's the best troubleshooting approach?"

**Systematic troubleshooting approach:**
1. **Enable Count mode** for problematic rules to analyze traffic patterns
2. **Review sampled requests** in WAF console for false positive identification
3. **Analyze WAF logs** for detailed rule match information and patterns
4. **Create rule exceptions** for legitimate traffic patterns
5. **Gradually re-enable Block mode** with monitoring for continued issues

**Common wrong answers:**
- Immediately disabling WAF rules without analysis
- Increasing rate limits without understanding traffic patterns
- Relying only on CloudWatch metrics without detailed log analysis

### Scenario-Based: Compliance-Driven Security Architecture
**Question Pattern:** "A financial services company needs web application protection that meets PCI DSS requirements including geographic restrictions, comprehensive logging, and protection against common web vulnerabilities. Design the architecture."

**Complete solution components:**
1. **CloudFront distribution** with global edge locations for performance and initial filtering
2. **AWS WAF** with managed rule groups covering OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
3. **Geographic restrictions** blocking access from non-authorized countries
4. **Rate limiting** for DDoS protection and abuse prevention
5. **Security headers** enforcing browser-level security controls
6. **Comprehensive logging** to CloudWatch and Security Hub for audit trails
7. **Origin protection** with OAC preventing direct access bypass

**Architecture considerations:**
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Compliance-ready logging and monitoring
- Performance optimization through edge caching and filtering
- Integration with existing security operations and incident response

## Common Trap Answers

### Architecture Questions
- **Regional WAF for global applications** (CloudFront requires global WAF)
- **Origin-only protection** without edge security controls
- **Security headers at origin** instead of CloudFront response policies
- **OAI for new implementations** (OAC is current best practice)

### Rule Configuration Questions
- **Block mode immediately** without Count mode testing (risk of false positives)
- **Custom rules for standard threats** (managed rule groups more efficient)
- **High rate limits** that don't provide meaningful protection
- **Geographic blocking without compliance justification**

### Integration Questions
- **WAF without CloudFront** for global protection requirements
- **CloudFront without WAF** for application layer threats
