# AWS Security Specialty Exam Preparation: Domain 3 Infrastructure Security

## Domain Focus Areas

This lab directly addresses critical concepts in **Domain 3: Infrastructure Security** (26% of exam weight), specifically the network security patterns that form the foundation of enterprise AWS architecture. Unlike Domain 4's policy logic, Domain 3 tests practical implementation knowledge of network controls and threat detection.

## Key Exam Topics Mastered

### 1. Multi-Tier VPC Architecture Design
**What the exam tests:**
- Understanding appropriate subnet design for different security requirements
- Choosing correct internet access patterns (IGW vs NAT Gateway vs no internet)
- Implementing network segmentation for compliance and security

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"A three-tier web application requires the database tier to be completely isolated from the internet while application servers need outbound access for updates. Design the network architecture."*

**Lab connection:** You implemented the exact pattern - public tier with IGW, app tier with NAT Gateway, data tier with no internet access.

### 2. Security Groups vs Network ACLs Decision Matrix
**What the exam tests:**
- Understanding stateful vs stateless traffic filtering
- Knowing when to use Security Groups vs NACLs vs both
- Configuring ephemeral port ranges for stateless filters

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"Application servers can connect to databases but the connection times out after establishing. Security Groups allow the traffic. What could be the issue?"*

**Lab connection:** You experienced exactly this - NACLs require explicit return traffic rules including ephemeral ports (1024-65535).

### 3. VPC Flow Logs Analysis and Threat Detection
**What the exam tests:**
- Interpreting VPC Flow Log entries for security analysis
- Understanding ACCEPT vs REJECT traffic patterns
- Using flow logs for threat hunting and incident response

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"VPC Flow Logs show repeated REJECT entries from external IPs to port 22 across multiple instances. What does this indicate and how should you respond?"*

**Lab connection:** You configured comprehensive flow log monitoring and will analyze these exact patterns during attack simulation.

### 4. Internet Gateway vs NAT Gateway Security Models
**What the exam tests:**
- Understanding bidirectional vs outbound-only internet access
- Knowing NAT Gateway placement requirements and dependencies
- Designing secure outbound access without exposing resources

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"Private subnet instances need software updates but should not be reachable from the internet. What's the most secure approach?"*

**Lab connection:** You implemented the exact solution - NAT Gateway in public subnet providing outbound-only access for private subnet resources.

## Advanced Network Security Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Network Segmentation for Compliance
**Exam Context:** Meeting regulatory requirements with network-level controls

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **PCI DSS compliance**: Cardholder data environment (CDE) isolation using network segments
- **HIPAA requirements**: PHI data tier completely isolated from internet access
- **SOX controls**: Administrative access through controlled network paths (bastion hosts)

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Choose network segmentation solutions that provide clear security boundaries with comprehensive monitoring.

### Scenario 2: Lateral Movement Prevention
**Exam Context:** Containing security incidents through network controls

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Application tier isolation**: App servers cannot SSH to each other by default
- **Database protection**: Data tier accepts only database traffic from app tier
- **Monitoring coverage**: VPC Flow Logs capture all lateral movement attempts

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Emphasize defense-in-depth with Security Groups, NACLs, and monitoring working together.

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Cloud Network Security
**Exam Context:** Extending on-premises security controls to AWS

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Consistent segmentation**: AWS network tiers mirror on-premises DMZ/LAN/secure zones
- **Policy enforcement**: Security Groups and NACLs equivalent to firewall rules
- **Monitoring integration**: VPC Flow Logs complement existing SIEM systems

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Design AWS network security that integrates with existing enterprise security architecture.

### Scenario 4: Incident Response and Forensics
**Exam Context:** Using network data for security incident investigation

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Traffic analysis**: VPC Flow Logs provide complete network forensics data
- **Attack timeline**: Flow log timestamps enable incident reconstruction
- **Response automation**: Network anomalies can trigger automated containment

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Include VPC Flow Logs in incident response and forensics procedures.

## Common Exam Question Patterns

### Multiple Choice: Architecture Design
**Question Pattern:** "A company needs to deploy a web application with strict security requirements. The database must be isolated from the internet, application servers need outbound access for updates, and load balancers must accept internet traffic. Design the network architecture."

**Key Discriminators:**
- **Database isolation** = Private subnet with no internet route
- **App server updates** = Private subnet with NAT Gateway route
- **Load balancer internet access** = Public subnet with Internet Gateway
- **Security controls** = Security Groups and NACLs for traffic control

**Common wrong answers:**
- Putting database servers in public subnets with restrictive Security Groups
- Using only Security Groups without subnet-level isolation
- Missing NAT Gateway for application server outbound access

### Multiple Choice: Traffic Flow Troubleshooting
**Question Pattern:** "Application servers can establish connections to the database, but connections are timing out. Security Groups allow the traffic on port 3306. What could be the issue?"

**Troubleshooting sequence:**
1. **Check NACLs** - Stateless filters need explicit return traffic rules
2. **Verify ephemeral ports** - Return traffic uses random high ports (1024-65535)
3. **Confirm route tables** - Ensure proper routing between subnets
4. **Check instance security** - Host-based firewalls or application issues

**Common wrong answers:**
- Security Group misconfiguration (already confirmed working)
- Route table issues (would prevent connection establishment)
- IGW/NAT Gateway problems (affects internet access, not inter-VPC)

### Scenario-Based: VPC Flow Log Analysis
**Question Pattern:** "VPC Flow Logs show the following entries. What do they indicate about network security?"

```
2 123456789012 eni-abc123 10.0.11.45 10.0.21.32 3306 43210 6 15 2100 1625097600 1625097660 ACCEPT OK
2 123456789012 eni-def456 203.0.113.45 10.0.11.45 22 12345 6 1 60 1625097601 1625097661 REJECT OK
```

**Analysis skills tested:**
- **First entry**: Legitimate app-to-database traffic (ACCEPT, port 3306)
- **Second entry**: Blocked SSH attempt from internet (REJECT, port 22)
- **Pattern recognition**: Normal application flow vs potential attack

**Key insights:**
- ACCEPT entries show allowed traffic patterns
- REJECT entries indicate blocked attacks or misconfigurations
- Source/destination analysis reveals traffic flow patterns

## Memory Aids for Exam Day

### Network Security Decision Tree

1. **Does resource need inbound internet access?** → Yes: Public subnet + IGW
2. **Does resource need outbound internet access only?** → Yes: Private subnet + NAT Gateway
3. **Should resource be completely isolated?** → Yes: Private subnet + no internet route
4. **Need stateful traffic filtering?** → Use Security Groups
5. **Need stateless backup filtering?** → Add NACLs

### VPC Flow Log Entry Analysis

```
version account-id interface-id srcaddr dstaddr srcport dstport protocol packets bytes start end action log-status
2       123456789  eni-abc123   10.0.1.5 10.0.11.5 80     43210   6        7       840   start end ACCEPT OK
```

**Key fields for exam:**
- **srcaddr/dstaddr**: Identify traffic source and destination
- **srcport/dstport**: Understand application protocols and direction
- **action**: ACCEPT (allowed) vs REJECT (blocked)
- **protocol**: 6=TCP, 17=UDP, 1=ICMP

### Security Group vs NACL Quick Reference

**Security Groups (Stateful)**:
- **Level**: Instance/ENI level
- **State**: Stateful (return traffic automatic)
- **Rules**: Allow rules only (default deny)
- **References**: Can reference other Security Groups
- **Use case**: Primary traffic filtering

**NACLs (Stateless)**:
- **Level**: Subnet level
- **State**: Stateless (explicit rules for both directions)
- **Rules**: Allow and Deny rules (numbered priority)
- **References**: CIDR blocks and port ranges only
- **Use case**: Backup filtering and explicit denies

### Internet Access Patterns

```
Public Subnet:    Internet ⟷ IGW ⟷ Resource (bidirectional)
Private + NAT:    Internet ← IGW ← NAT ← Resource (outbound only)
Private Isolated: [No internet path] Resource (completely isolated)
```

**Security implications:**
- **Public**: Exposed to inbound attacks, requires Security Groups
- **NAT**: Protected from inbound, can reach internet for updates
- **Isolated**: Maximum security, no internet connectivity

**A)** All tiers in public subnets with restrictive Security Groups  
**B)** Database in private subnet with no internet route, applications in private subnet with NAT Gateway  
**C)** Database in private subnet with NAT Gateway, applications in public subnet  
**D)** All tiers in private subnets with VPC endpoints for AWS services  

**Answer:** B - Database isolation with no internet route, applications get outbound access via NAT Gateway.

### Question 2
VPC Flow Logs show repeated entries with action "REJECT" from external IP addresses targeting port 22 across multiple instances. What does this most likely indicate?

**A)** Legitimate administrative access being blocked by misconfigured Security Groups  
**B)** SSH brute force attack being successfully blocked by network controls  
**C)** Application servers attempting outbound SSH connections  
**D)** Database connection timeouts due to NACL misconfiguration  

**Answer:** B - External IPs targeting SSH (port 22) with REJECT action indicates blocked attack attempts.

### Question 3
An application can establish TCP connections to a database on port 3306, but connections time out after being established. Security Groups allow the traffic. What is the most likely cause?

**A)** Internet Gateway misconfiguration  
**B)** NAT Gateway placement in wrong subnet  
**C)** Network ACL missing return traffic rules for ephemeral ports  
**D)** Route table not associated with correct subnet  

**Answer:** C - Stateless NACLs need explicit rules for return traffic on ephemeral ports (1024-65535).

### Question 4
Which combination provides the most comprehensive network security for a multi-tier application?

**A)** Security Groups only with detailed rules  
**B)** Network ACLs only with subnet-level filtering  
**C)** Security Groups for primary filtering plus NACLs for backup protection  
**D)** VPC Flow Logs for monitoring without additional filtering  

**Answer:** C - Defense in depth using both stateful (Security Groups) and stateless (NACLs) filtering.

### Question 5
A NAT Gateway is configured in a private subnet but instances cannot reach the internet. What is the most likely issue?

**A)** Security Groups blocking outbound traffic  
**B)** NAT Gateway needs to be in a public subnet with Internet Gateway route  
**C)** Route table missing local VPC route  
**D)** Network ACL blocking return traffic  

**Answer:** B - NAT Gateway requires public subnet placement and IGW route for its own internet connectivity.
