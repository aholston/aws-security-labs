# Exam Tips: Permission Boundaries and Break-Glass Access

## Core Concepts Frequently Tested

### Permission Boundary Fundamentals

**Key Principle**: Permission boundaries define **maximum permissions**, never grant them
- **Effective permissions** = Identity Policy ∩ Permission Boundary
- **Cannot be removed** by users themselves
- **Apply to users and roles**, not groups or resources
- **Evaluated before** identity policies in permission logic

### Policy Evaluation Order (Critical for Exam)

1. **Organization SCPs** → Can only deny/restrict
2. **Permission Boundaries** → Can only deny/restrict  
3. **Identity-based Policies** → Grant permissions
4. **Resource-based Policies** → Grant permissions

**Final decision**: ALLOW only if all applicable policies allow the action

## Common Exam Question Patterns

### Scenario 1: "User has Admin policy but can't perform action"

**Question Pattern**: "Developer has AdministratorAccess policy but gets AccessDenied when creating IAM roles. What's the cause?"

**Answer Strategy**:
1. Check for permission boundary restrictions
2. Look for SCP limitations  
3. Verify no explicit deny statements
4. **Most likely**: Permission boundary doesn't include IAM actions

**Example Answer**: Permission boundary policy restricts maximum permissions regardless of identity policy grants.

### Scenario 2: "Emergency access design for compliance"

**Question Pattern**: "Design emergency administrative access that automatically expires and maintains audit trails."

**Key Components**:
- Time-limited roles (4-8 hour session duration)
- External ID for deliberate access
- EventBridge detection for real-time monitoring
- Lambda automation for revocation
- CloudTrail integration for compliance

**Answer Focus**: Automated controls and comprehensive logging.

### Scenario 3: "Cross-account permission boundary management"

**Question Pattern**: "Identity Center users need permission boundaries that work across multiple accounts."

**Key Points**:
- Boundary policies must exist in target accounts
- Identity Center uses policy name matching, not ARN references
- Policy synchronization required across accounts
- Protected roles cannot be directly modified

### Scenario 4: "Permission boundary troubleshooting"

**Question Pattern**: "Role has necessary permissions but still gets AccessDenied. Troubleshoot the issue."

**Systematic Approach**:
1. Check if permission boundary allows the action
2. Verify identity policy grants the permission  
3. Look for explicit deny statements
4. Check resource-based policies if applicable
5. Consider SCP restrictions

## Identity Center Specific Gotchas

### Federated Session Limitations

**MFA Requirements**: Identity Center federated sessions may not satisfy `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` conditions
- Use External ID instead of MFA requirements
- Identity Center handles MFA during initial authentication

**User ID Patterns**: Federated users have dynamic ARNs
- Use `aws:userid` conditions with specific user ID
- Pattern: `AROA[RANDOM]:username`
- Get actual ID from `aws sts get-caller-identity`

**Protected Roles**: Identity Center roles cannot be directly modified
- Use Identity Center console for role management
- Permission boundaries managed through permission sets
- Direct IAM modifications will fail with `UnmodifiableEntity`

## Break-Glass Access Best Practices

### Security Controls

**Deliberate Access**:
- External ID requirement prevents accidental assumption
- Specific user conditions limit access scope
- Session naming with timestamps for audit trails

**Automated Cleanup**:
- EventBridge detection for immediate response
- Lambda scheduling for reliable revocation
- Maximum session duration as backup control

**Audit Requirements**:
- CloudTrail logging for all emergency access events
- Lambda logs for automation verification  
- EventBridge metrics for monitoring effectiveness

### Common Implementation Mistakes

**Trust Policy Errors**:
```json
// WRONG - MFA requirement incompatible with Identity Center
"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"}

// CORRECT - External ID provides security
"StringEquals": {"sts:ExternalId": "emergency-key"}
```

**Permission Boundary Scope**:
```json
// WRONG - Too restrictive, missing emergency access
"Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/SpecificRole"

// CORRECT - Includes emergency role assumption
"Resource": [
  "arn:aws:iam::account:role/EmergencyRole",
  "arn:aws:iam::account:role/OtherAllowedRoles"
]
```

## Memory Aids for Exam Day

### Permission Boundary Decision Tree

1. **Does boundary policy allow the action?** → If NO, then DENY
2. **Does identity policy allow the action?** → If NO, then DENY  
3. **Are there any explicit denies?** → If YES, then DENY
4. **If all allow and no denies** → ALLOW

### Emergency Access Components Checklist

- ✅ **Time-limited role** (max session duration)
- ✅ **External ID requirement** (prevents accidents)
- ✅ **Broad but limited permissions** (emergency needs only)
- ✅ **EventBridge detection** (real-time monitoring)
- ✅ **Lambda automation** (scheduled revocation)
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** (compliance and audit)

### Policy Troubleshooting Sequence

1. **Check boundary** → Look for missing Allow statements
2. **Check identity** → Verify permissions are granted
3. **Check denies** → Explicit deny overrides everything
4. **Check conditions** → Ensure they evaluate to true
5. **Check resources** → Verify ARNs match exactly

## High-Value Exam Topics

### Most Tested Concepts (Study Priority 1)

- Permission boundary vs identity policy interaction
- Cross-account boundary policy management with Identity Center
- Emergency access design patterns with automation
- Policy evaluation precedence and troubleshooting methodology

### Moderately Tested Concepts (Study Priority 2)

- Federated user trust policy conditions
- EventBridge integration with IAM events
- Lambda-based automation for access management
- Session duration and token management

### Less Tested but Important (Study Priority 3)

- Specific AWS service integration with boundaries
- Complex conditional access patterns
- Multi-policy evaluation scenarios
- Advanced CloudTrail analysis for IAM events

## Quick Reference Commands

### Boundary Verification
```bash
# Check role boundary attachment
aws iam get-role --role-name RoleName | grep PermissionsBoundary

# Verify boundary policy content  
aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn PolicyArn --version-id v1

# Check effective permissions
aws iam simulate-principal-policy --policy-source-arn RoleArn --action-names Action
```

### Emergency Access Testing
```bash
# Test role assumption
aws sts assume-role --role-arn RoleArn --role-session-name test --external-id ExternalId

# Check automation logs
aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/FunctionName --start-time TimeStamp

# Verify EventBridge rules
aws events list-rules --name-prefix RulePrefix
```
