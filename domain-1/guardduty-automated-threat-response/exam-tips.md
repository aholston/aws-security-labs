## Key Exam Topics Mastered

### 1. Behavioral vs Signature-Based Threat Detection
**What the exam tests:**
- Understanding machine learning-based anomaly detection capabilities
- Distinguishing behavioral analysis from traditional signature matching
- Recognizing appropriate use cases for different detection methodologies

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"A company needs to detect unknown malware variants and zero-day attacks that bypass traditional antivirus. Which AWS service provides machine learning-based behavioral analysis for this requirement?"*

**Lab connection:** You implemented GuardDuty's behavioral detection across multiple data sources, experiencing how ML models identify threats without predefined signatures.

### 2. Multi-Account Security Service Administration
**What the exam tests:**
- Delegated administrator configuration for security services
- Cross-account finding aggregation and correlation patterns
- Organization-wide security service management without root account access

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"An organization with 50 AWS accounts needs centralized GuardDuty management. The security team should manage all findings from a dedicated security account without accessing individual account credentials. What's the most efficient approach?"*

**Lab connection:** You configured the exact delegated administration pattern tested in exam scenarios, with organization-level trusted access and centralized finding management.

### 3. Automated Incident Response Architecture
**What the exam tests:**
- EventBridge integration patterns for security automation
- Cross-account automated remediation with security controls
- Forensic preservation during automated containment procedures

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"Design automated response to cryptocurrency mining detection that isolates instances within 60 seconds while preserving evidence for investigation and maintaining audit trails for compliance."*

**Lab connection:** You built the complete automated response pipeline with EventBridge orchestration, cross-account Lambda execution, and forensic snapshot preservation.

### 4. Cross-Account Security Automation
**What the exam tests:**
- External ID implementation for automated cross-account access
- Confused deputy attack prevention in security automation
- Least-privilege automation with explicit deny statements

**Real exam question pattern:**
*"An automated security response system needs to perform remediation across multiple AWS accounts. What mechanism prevents unauthorized access if the automation credentials are compromised while enabling legitimate cross-account operations?"*

**Lab connection:** You implemented the exact External ID pattern with cross-account trust policies and least-privilege remediation roles tested in security scenarios.

## Common Exam Question Patterns

### Multiple Choice: Service Selection
**Question Pattern:** "A company needs automated threat detection that adapts to new attack patterns without manual signature updates. Which AWS service provides this capability?"

**Key Discriminators:**
- **GuardDuty**: Machine learning-based behavioral analysis (correct for adaptive detection)
- **AWS WAF**: Rule-based web application protection (signature-based)
- **Amazon Inspector**: Vulnerability assessment (not threat detection)
- **AWS Config**: Configuration compliance monitoring (not threat detection)

**Common wrong answers:**
- WAF for network threat detection (limited to web applications)
- Inspector for runtime threat detection (vulnerability scanning only)
- Config for behavioral analysis (compliance monitoring only)

### Multiple Choice: Architecture Design
**Question Pattern:** "An organization needs to respond to GuardDuty cryptocurrency mining findings within 60 seconds across 100 AWS accounts. What architecture provides the most effective solution?"

**Solution Components:**
1. **GuardDuty** with delegated administration for centralized management
2. **Security Hub** for cross-account finding aggregation and workflow management
3. **EventBridge** with pattern-based routing for intelligent automation triggering
4. **Lambda** with cross-account roles for automated remediation execution

**Common wrong answers:**
- CloudWatch Events instead of EventBridge (legacy service)
- SNS-only notification without automated response
- Account-specific automation without centralized management

### Scenario-Based: Implementation Design
**Question Pattern:** "Design automated response to DNS data exfiltration that preserves forensic evidence while meeting 1-minute response time requirements and maintaining compliance audit trails."

**Complete solution architecture:**
1. **GuardDuty DNS log analysis** for behavioral detection of data exfiltration patterns
2. **Security Hub integration** for centralized finding management and workflow tracking
3. **EventBridge rule** with DNS exfiltration pattern matching for immediate response triggering
4. **Lambda automation** with cross-account role assumption for instance isolation
5. **EBS snapshot creation** for forensic evidence preservation during containment
6. **Security group quarantine** for network isolation while maintaining instance integrity
7. **CloudTrail logging** for comprehensive audit trail of all automated actions

**Architecture considerations:**
- Non-destructive containment for evidence preservation
- Sub-60-second response through event-driven automation
- Cross-account security with External ID protection
- Comprehensive audit trails for compliance requirements

**A)** Enable GuardDuty in each account individually with cross-account IAM roles  
**B)** Configure GuardDuty with delegated administration from the security account  
**C)** Use AWS Config to detect cryptocurrency mining indicators across accounts  
**D)** Implement custom CloudTrail analysis with Lambda functions in each account  

**Answer:** B - Delegated administration provides centralized management without requiring individual account access.

### Question 2
An automated security response system detects GuardDuty findings and performs cross-account remediation. What security mechanism prevents unauthorized access if the automation credentials are compromised?

**A)** MFA requirements on automation IAM roles  
**B)** IP-based restrictions on cross-account trust policies  
**C)** External ID requirements in role assumption calls  
**D)** Time-based conditions limiting automation to business hours  

**Answer:** C - External ID prevents confused deputy attacks and provides security for cross-account automation.

### Question 3
A GuardDuty finding indicates DNS data exfiltration from an EC2 instance. The automated response should isolate the instance while preserving evidence. Which containment method is most appropriate?

**A)** Terminate the instance immediately to stop data exfiltration  
**B)** Replace security groups with quarantine rules and create EBS snapshots  
**C)** Stop the instance and detach all network interfaces  
**D)** Modify VPC route tables to block all traffic from the instance  

**Answer:** B - Non-destructive containment preserves the instance and creates forensic evidence while stopping network communication.

### Question 4
An organization needs GuardDuty threat detection that responds within 60 seconds. The response should include human notification and automated containment. Which architecture provides this capability?

**A)** GuardDuty → SNS → Manual investigation and response  
**B)** GuardDuty → Security Hub → EventBridge → Lambda + SNS  
**C)** GuardDuty → CloudWatch → Lambda → Manual verification  
**D)** GuardDuty → Config → Auto Remediation → SNS  

**Answer:** B - Security Hub aggregation with EventBridge automation provides both immediate automated response and human notification.

### Question 5
A GuardDuty deployment needs to analyze VPC Flow Logs, DNS queries, and API calls for comprehensive threat detection. Which data sources should be enabled?

**A)** VPC Flow Logs only (most comprehensive single source)  
**B)** CloudTrail Events only (covers all API activity)  
**C)** VPC Flow Logs, DNS Logs, and CloudTrail Events  
**D)** S3 Data Events only (covers data access patterns)  

**Answer:** C - Multiple data sources provide comprehensive threat detection across network, DNS, and API activity.
