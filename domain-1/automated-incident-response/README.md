# Automated Incident Response to Suspicious IAM Activity

This lab builds comprehensive automated incident response capabilities for IAM security threats using AWS Security Hub, EventBridge, and Lambda. It demonstrates enterprise-grade threat containment patterns that respond to security incidents within 60 seconds while preserving forensic evidence and maintaining complete audit trails.

The lab emphasizes:
- Real-time IAM threat detection and automated containment
- Cross-account security orchestration with least-privilege access
- Production-ready incident response workflows with comprehensive logging
- Enterprise security patterns for SOC automation and compliance

## Prerequisites

This lab extends the foundational Security Hub detection setup:
- AWS Organization with Security Hub administrator/member relationship
- EventBridge integration with Security Hub configured for finding processing
- SNS alerting infrastructure for security team notifications
- CloudTrail logging enabled for comprehensive audit trails

## Phase 1: Lambda-Powered Automated Remediation

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Implement cross-account automated remediation with proper security controls
- Master External ID patterns for confused deputy attack prevention
- Build production-ready incident response with forensic preservation
- Practice enterprise SOC automation patterns and audit requirements

### âš¡ Key Exam Topics Covered
- Domain 1.3: Respond to compromised resources and workloads (automated response)
- Cross-account IAM remediation patterns (heavily tested scenarios)
- Security Hub finding lifecycle management and workflow automation
- EventBridge integration patterns for security orchestration

## Implementation Summary

### Step 1: Automated Remediation Engine
- **Account**: security-account (Security Hub administrator)
- **Function**: `SecurityHubIAMRemediation` Lambda with intelligent finding processing
- **Capabilities**: Policy detachment, access key deactivation, group removal, forensic tagging

### Step 2: Cross-Account Security Role
- **Account**: prod-account (target resources)
- **Role**: `SecurityRemediationRole` with least-privilege remediation permissions
- **Security**: External ID requirement, explicit deny on destructive operations

### Step 3: EventBridge Orchestration
- **Integration**: Dual-target EventBridge rule (SNS + Lambda)
- **Pattern**: HIGH/CRITICAL severity IAM findings with NEW workflow status
- **Flow**: Parallel human notification and automated containment

### Step 4: Comprehensive Testing
- **Scenario**: Dangerous IAM user with AdministratorAccess policy
- **Validation**: Policy detachment, access key deactivation, forensic tagging
- **Verification**: Complete audit trail and finding status updates

## Security Design Principles

### Automated Threat Containment
**Speed**: Mean time to containment reduced from hours to under 60 seconds
**Precision**: Intelligent finding analysis with type-specific remediation actions
**Safety**: Non-destructive containment preserves user accounts for investigation

### Cross-Account Security Controls
**External ID**: Prevents confused deputy attacks in cross-account role assumption
**Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions with explicit deny on destructive operations
**Audit Trail**: Complete CloudTrail logging of all cross-account remediation actions

### Forensic Evidence Preservation
**User Account Retention**: Users disabled but preserved for investigation
**Security Tagging**: Incident metadata, remediation timestamps, finding references
**Finding Lifecycle**: Bidirectional Security Hub updates for compliance tracking

---

## Real-World Application Scenarios

### Enterprise SOC Automation
- **24/7 incident response** without human intervention for common threats
- **Escalation workflows** for complex scenarios requiring manual analysis
- **Compliance reporting** with automated finding resolution documentation

### Multi-Account Security Operations
- **Centralized remediation** from Security Hub administrator account
- **Distributed execution** across member accounts with proper isolation
- **Consistent response** regardless of account size or complexity

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Immediate containment** meeting incident response time requirements
- **Complete audit trails** for compliance reporting and forensic analysis
- **Evidence preservation** maintaining investigative capabilities

---

## Key Implementation Discoveries

### EventBridge Integration Patterns
**Dual Targeting**: Single rule triggering both human notification (SNS) and automated response (Lambda)
**Event Pattern Precision**: Exact matching on finding severity, workflow status, and content
**Cross-Account Events**: Security Hub findings flow from member to administrator accounts

### Lambda Security Architecture
**Cross-Account Role Assumption**: External ID provides security while enabling automation
**Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
**Timeout Management**: Efficient remediation within Lambda execution limits

### Security Hub Finding Management
**Bidirectional Sync**: Finding status updates in administrator account sync to member accounts
**Product ARN Complexity**: Cross-account finding updates require proper ARN formatting
**Workflow States**: NEW â†’ IN_PROGRESS â†’ RESOLVED lifecycle with automated transitions
