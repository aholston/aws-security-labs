## Advanced Incident Response Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Service Security Orchestration
**Exam Context:** Coordinating automated response across multiple AWS security services

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Security Hub**: Central finding aggregation and workflow management
- **EventBridge**: Event-driven orchestration with pattern matching
- **Lambda**: Execution engine for automated remediation actions
- **SNS**: Human notification for scenarios requiring manual intervention

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Choose architectures that integrate multiple security services with clear separation of automated and manual response triggers.

### Scenario 2: Cross-Account Automation Security
**Exam Context:** Implementing secure automated access across AWS Organization accounts

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **External ID requirement**: Prevents confused deputy attacks in automation
- **Least-privilege roles**: Minimal permissions with explicit deny on destructive actions
- **Trust policy specificity**: Exact principal identification for automated systems

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Always include External ID for cross-account automation scenarios and implement explicit permission boundaries.

### Scenario 3: Compliance-Driven Incident Response
**Exam Context:** Meeting regulatory requirements for incident response timing and documentation

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Sub-60-second response**: Automated containment faster than manual processes
- **Complete audit trails**: CloudTrail logging of all remediation actions
- **Evidence preservation**: Non-destructive containment maintaining investigation capabilities

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Emphasize automated response speed while maintaining comprehensive logging and forensic preservation.

### Scenario 4: Escalation and Fallback Patterns
**Exam Context:** Handling scenarios that require human intervention within automated systems

**Key Learning from Lab:**
- **Dual-target EventBridge**: Parallel automation and human notification
- **Intelligent routing**: Type-specific remediation with manual escalation for edge cases
- **Graceful degradation**: Automated attempts with manual fallback for failures

**Exam Answer Pattern:** Design systems with clear automated/manual boundaries and proper escalation mechanisms.

## Common Exam Question Patterns

### Multiple Choice: Architecture Selection
**Question Pattern:** "A company needs automated response to security incidents with proper audit trails and evidence preservation. Which AWS service combination provides this capability?"

**Key Discriminators:**
- **Security Hub + EventBridge + Lambda** = Automated incident response
- **Security Hub + SNS** = Human notification only
- **CloudTrail + CloudWatch** = Monitoring and alerting, not response
- **Config + Lambda** = Configuration management, not security incidents

**Common wrong answers:**
- CloudWatch Events (legacy) instead of EventBridge
- Direct Lambda triggers without Security Hub integration
- SNS-only solutions without automated remediation

### Multiple Choice: Security Controls
**Question Pattern:** "An automated remediation system assumes roles across multiple accounts to perform security actions. What prevents unauthorized access if the automation credentials are compromised?"

**Troubleshooting sequence:**
1. **External ID requirement** - Prevents confused deputy attacks
2. **Least-privilege policies** - Limits blast radius of compromise
3. **Explicit deny statements** - Prevents destructive actions
4. **CloudTrail logging** - Provides audit trail for investigation

**Common wrong answers:**
- MFA requirements (not applicable to automated systems)
- IP-based restrictions (Lambda IPs are dynamic)
- Time-based restrictions (automation runs 24/7)

### Scenario-Based: Implementation Design
**Question Pattern:** "Design automated incident response for IAM privilege escalation that preserves evidence while meeting 1-minute response time requirements."

**Complete solution components:**
1. **Security Hub** with appropriate security standards enabled for IAM monitoring
2. **EventBridge rule** with HIGH/CRITICAL severity pattern matching
3. **Lambda function** with cross-account remediation logic and External ID security
4. **Cross-account IAM roles** with least-privilege permissions and explicit denies
5. **SNS integration** for immediate human notification and escalation
6. **CloudTrail logging** for complete audit trail and compliance documentation

**Architecture considerations:**
- Non-destructive containment (disable, don't delete)
- Forensic tagging for investigation workflow
- Bidirectional finding status updates for operational visibility

## Memory Aids for Exam Day

### Automated Incident Response Decision Tree

1. **Is immediate response required?** → Yes: Consider automation
2. **Are there compliance/audit requirements?** → Yes: Include comprehensive logging
3. **Is evidence preservation needed?** → Yes: Non-destructive containment only
4. **Cross-account access required?** → Yes: External ID + least privilege
5. **Human oversight needed?** → Yes: Dual notification (automation + human)

### Security Hub Automation Pattern

```
Finding Creation → EventBridge Rule → Lambda Function → Cross-Account Role → Remediation Actions
     ↓                    ↓                ↓                    ↓                   ↓
  Severity: HIGH     Pattern Match    External ID        Least Privilege    Non-Destructive
  Status: NEW        IAM + CRITICAL   Trust Policy       Permissions        + Forensic Tags
```

### External ID Best Practices

**Required for:**
- Cross-account automation roles
- Third-party service integration
- Automated security remediation systems

**Implementation:**
- Static, hard-to-guess value
- Included in both trust policy and assume-role calls
- Different values for different automation purposes

**Common mistakes:**
- Forgetting External ID in Lambda assume-role calls
- Using easily guessable External ID values
- Same External ID across multiple automation systems

## Quick Reference Patterns

### EventBridge Security Hub Pattern

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.securityhub"],
  "detail-type": ["Security Hub Findings - Imported"],
  "detail": {
    "findings": {
      "Severity": {"Label": ["HIGH", "CRITICAL"]},
      "Workflow": {"Status": ["NEW"]},
      "Title": [{"wildcard": "*IAM*"}]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cross-Account Trust Policy Template

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::SECURITY-ACCOUNT:role/AutomationRole"},
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {"sts:ExternalId": "unique-automation-key"}
    }
  }]
}
```

### Lambda Remediation Pattern

```python
# Key components always tested
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # 1. Parse Security Hub finding
    findings = event['detail']['findings']
    
    # 2. Assess severity and type
    if severity in ['HIGH', 'CRITICAL'] and 'IAM' in title:
        
        # 3. Assume cross-account role with External ID
        iam_client = assume_remediation_role(account_id)
        
        # 4. Non-destructive containment
        detach_policies_preserve_user(username)
        
        # 5. Apply forensic tags
        tag_for_investigation(username, finding_id)
        
        # 6. Update finding status
        update_security_hub_workflow(finding_id)
```
